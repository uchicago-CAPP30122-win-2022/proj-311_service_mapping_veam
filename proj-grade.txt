Note on the Rubric 
------------------
Although some of the grading criteria may appear subjective to you, I was as objective as possible and assigned almost all the grades using checkpoints on the essential parts that we required for the project. 

The soft criterium I used is mostly concentrated on items #2 (Data Analysis) and #3 (Scope and Complexity). The final grade for those items resulted from an evaluation of all the projects as a whole. I also recognized in those rubrics team's effort and dedication. I considered a project more complex if it required different types of skills and used more diverse content we covered in during the quarter (e.g., if the team downloaded and used two ready-to-use data sets VS if the data was constructed using complex webscraping, data cleaning, record linkage, used more advanced data vis packages (e.g., Django, dash, etc.) and everything was stored in a relational SQL database).

Please note that these grades are final! I will not make any grade adjusts unless it is due to an arithmetic error, even if you feel the deduction is too much. Project scores are final. 

As always with assignments, feel free to reach out if you do have any questions about improvement or clarification. Please respond via email if you do have any questions (not on Ed). I will be busy preparing for the next quarter so I may not have a chance to respond right away.

Overall Comments: Overall great project! It's very interesting to see how various factors (race, income, etc.) play a roll in responsiveness from city requests. Great job on the seperate analysis portion of the project. I appreciate the dedication to really diving deep into interactions of the data.  One comment about your code: 

1. Structure Deduction: You need better naming for your various visual components. Calling it "graph_bars", "grap_map1" is not very descriptive and can be hard for someone to understand what that actually means.
